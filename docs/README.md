# Canvas/Panel Architecture Tutorials

Welcome to the Canvas/Panel Architecture Tutorials for the canvas-panel-playground repository! These tutorials are designed to help you become more familiar with our canvas/panel architecture and how to effectively use it to build applications.

## Overview

The canvas-panel-playground is a simple implementation of the canvas/panel architecture, showcasing how panels can be utilized to create highly configurable and framework-agnostic applications. These tutorials will walk you through various aspects of working with the canvas/panel architecture, from creating panels to handling events and more.

## Tutorials

### 1. Creating Panels

Learn how to create new panels and add them to the canvas.
